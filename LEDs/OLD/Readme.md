# Overview

Hi Milda,

I wanted to include these to show my efforts on this project, even though we had 
to remove this from our final project implementation due to both the speakers and
the lights being blocking functions. 

In this folder, there is code that:
- extracts bpm & beat timestamp data from audio (wav) files
- contains helper functions to make lights light according to BPM
- starts a backend server to publish the audio computation results for the arduino
  to access
